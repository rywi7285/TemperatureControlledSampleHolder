# Temperature Controlled Sample Holder

Included are 3D files for the temperature controlled sample holder that was used to perform temperature dependent fluorescence measurements. Specifics on the optics within the sample holder can be found in a previous paper.

Results of temperature dependent fluorescence measurements:

3D files for screws, springs, ball bearings, and hose fittings taken from McMasterCarr website.

3D files for lens tubes and lens tube adapters taken from ThorLabs.

3D files for the 2mmCuvette, CuvetteHolderBody, and CuvetteHolderFace were modelled by myself.
The 2mmCuvette is modeled after a 2mm path length quartz cuvette.
The CuvetteHolderBody and CuvetteHolderFace were designed to be stable, repeatable, and machinable on a conventional milling machine.

Autodesk Inventor Part files included to see assembly. STEP files included for custom modeled parts just in case.
